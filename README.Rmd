# Monte Carlo Goodness of Fit tests for Stochastic Block Models
## Intended use of the package

<!-- badges: start -->
There are various statistical models exist in the literature to fit network data. But a natural statistical question arises whether the fit is good or bad. A chi-square goodness of fit test conditioning on sufficient statistics was proposed (Karwa et al.) for several popular stochastic block models (SBM). My package now focuses only on a special case of those i.e, ERSBM. Also, we have mainly focused on a simple undirected, unweighted network with no self-loop. The main function `goftest` take the adjacency matrix and the block assignment of each node as input. It fits the ERSBM model on the corresponding graph of the adjacency matrix and after performing a chi-square goodness of fit test, gives the value of the test statistic and p-value as outputs.

## Installation

To install the package "MCGoFSBM", the library "devtools" need to be installed there. Thereafter, You can install the development version of the package from  [GitHub](https://github.com/GhoshSoham/MCGoFSBM) using the following commands in the console:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/GhoshSoham/MCGoFSBM")
```

## Left for the project
Till now, I have assumed that the block assignment of each node is known to users. I am planning to update the function when the block assignment is not known to the user but has an idea about how many blocks are there. As the code is not optimized fully, I am planning to implement some loops in cpp. Apart from that, I am yet to add some more compatibility checks, formally cite the references, and run some formal tests to ensure correctness. I also have planned to add some examples with the functions in the documentation.         


## Other
When I submitted the proposal, I proposed that I will focus on different stochastic block models discussed in (Karwa et al.) with known block assignment rather than the case when block assignment is not known for the nodes. But later I thought it will be better to focus on a particular model i.e, ERSBM now. If time permits, I will upgrade the package for other block models discussed in the paper.  

<!-- ## Example -->

<!-- This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem: -->

<!-- ```{r example} -->
<!-- library(MCGoFSBM) -->
<!-- ## basic example code -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN. -->
